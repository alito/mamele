CMD quickloads for the TRS-80 Model 1 Level 2, and clones.

Compatibility flags:
1 = trs80l2 and clones
3 = trs80m3
H = HT series
M = meritum

If no flag is specified, it's assumed it works on all of them.
The increased speed of meritum machines generally makes these games unplayable.
Quickloads cannot be used on trs80m4 due to memory issues.

A CMD file is an executable file found on TRS-80 floppy disks. Some don't require a disk to work,
simply needing a Level 2-based machine to run on. That is what you'll find in this list.
