.SH SYNOPSIS
.B nltool
[\fI\,option\/\fR]... [\fI\,files\/\fR]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
nltool serves as the Swiss Army knife to run, test and convert netlists.
.PP
Commands may accept one or more files depending on the functionality.
If no file is provided, standard input is used.
.SH OPTIONS
.SS "General options:"
.IP
The following options apply to all commands.
.HP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-cmd\fR=\fI\,run\/\fR|validate|convert|listdevices|listmodels|static|header|docheader|tests
.IP
run|validate|convert|listdevices|listmodels|static|header|docheader|tests
.TP
\fB\-I\fR, \fB\-\-include\fR=\fI\,Value\/\fR
Add the directory to the list of directories to be
searched for header files. This option may be
specified repeatedly.
.TP
\fB\-D\fR, \fB\-\-define\fR=\fI\,Value\/\fR
predefine value as macro, e.g. \fB\-Dname\fR=\fI\,value\/\fR. If
\&'=value' is omitted predefine it as 1. This option
may be specified repeatedly.
.TP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-rom\fR=\fI\,Value\/\fR
where to look for data files
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
be verbose \- this produces lots of output
.TP
\fB\-q\fR, \fB\-\-quiet\fR
be quiet \- no warnings
.TP
\fB\-\-prepro\fR
output preprocessor output to stderr
.TP
\fB\-\-progress\fR
show progress bar on longer operations
.TP
\fB\-\-version\fR
display version and exit
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
display help and exit
.SS "Options for run and static commands:"
.IP

.TP
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-name\fR=\fI\,Value\/\fR

.SS "Options for static command:"
.IP
These options apply to static command.
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-dir\fR=\fI\,Value\/\fR
output directory for the generated files.
.TP
\fB\-o\fR, \fB\-\-output\fR=\fI\,Value\/\fR
single output file for the generated code.
Either \fB\-\-dir\fR or \fB\-\-output\fR can be specificied
.TP
\fB\-\-static_include\fR
write static solvers to individual files included by
file specified with \fB\-\-output\fR. \fB\-\-dir\fR must be path to
"generated/static" path in netlist folder.
.SS "Options for run command:"
.IP
These options are only used by the run command.
.TP
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-time_to_run\fR=\fI\,Value\/\fR
time to run the emulation (seconds)
.TP
\fB\-\-boost_lib\fR=\fI\,Value\/\fR
generic: will use generic solvers.
builtin: Use optimized solvers compiled in.
somelib.so: Use library with precompiled solvers.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-statistics\fR
gather runtime statistics
.TP
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-log\fR=\fI\,Value\/\fR
define terminal to log. This option may be specified
repeatedly.
.TP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-input\fR=\fI\,Value\/\fR
input file to process (default is none)
.TP
\fB\-\-loadstate\fR=\fI\,Value\/\fR
load state from file and continue from there
.TP
\fB\-\-savestate\fR=\fI\,Value\/\fR
save state to file at end of run
.TP
\fB\-\-fperr\fR
raise exception on floating point errors. This is
intended to be used during debugging.
.SS "Options for convert command:"
.IP
These options are only used by the convert command.
.TP
\fB\-y\fR, \fB\-\-type\fR=\fI\,spice\/\fR|eagle|rinf
type of file to be converted: spice,eagle,rinf
.SS "Options for validate command:"
.IP
These options are only used by the validate command.
.SS "Options for header command:"
.IP
These options are only used by the header command.
.TP
\fB\-\-tab\-width\fR=\fI\,Value\/\fR
Tab width for output.
.TP
\fB\-\-line\-width\fR=\fI\,Value\/\fR
Line width for output.
.TP
\fB\-\-pattern\fR=\fI\,Value\/\fR
Pattern to match against device names. If the device
name contains pattern, the device will be included
in the output. Multiple patterns can be specified,
if none is given, all devices will be output.
