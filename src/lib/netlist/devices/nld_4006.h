 *  CD4006: CMOS 18-Stage Static Register
 *
 * Description
 *
 * CD4006BMS types are composed of 4 separate shift register sections: two
 * sections of four stages and two sections of five stages with an output tap
 * at the fourth stage. Each section has an independent single-rail data path.
 *
 * A common clock signal is used for all stages. Data are shifted to the next
 * stages on negative-going transitions of the clock. Through appropriate
 * connections of inputs and outputs, multiple register sections of 4, 5, 8,
 * and 9 stages or single register sections of 10, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17 and 18
 * stages can be implemented using one CD4006BMS package. Longer shift register
 * sections can be assembled by using more than one CD4006BMS.
 *
 * To facilitate cascading stages when clock rise and fall times are slow,
 * an optional output (D1 + 4â€™) that is delayed one-half clockcycle, is
 * provided.
