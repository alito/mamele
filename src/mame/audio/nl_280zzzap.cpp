// This is a netlist description for the sound circuits of Midway's 280-ZZZAP
// and Laguna Racer, based on Midway's schematics "280 ZZZAP Game Logic P.C.
// 0610-00907A", "Laguna Racer Game Logic A084-90700-A622", and "Laguna Racer
// Game Logic A084-90700-B622". Midway PCB drawings for Laguna Racer and a
// photo by Andrew Wellburn of a 280-ZZZAP game logic board were also used to
// help determine correct values for certain components. The netlist should
// also apply to Taito/Midway's Super Speed Race with only modest changes,
// because that game uses very similar sound circuits to 280-ZZZAP and Laguna
// Racer.

// (Incidentally, the 280-ZZZAP schematic has some notes on changes made to
// the circuitry during production, a few of which were to audio circuits.
// This netlist uses the final state of the schematic, but it could be
// adjusted to the earlier state by modifying a couple of component values.)

// Due to its complexity, this netlist is rather CPU intensive. Various
// speedups have been employed to allow the game to run at full speed on
// modern hardware with some CPU to spare. The main sources of complexity are
// the op-amps (15 of them, all of which are National Semiconductor LM3900
// current-differencing "Norton-type" op-amps) and the Motorola MC3340
// Electronic Attenuator, the latter of which is emulated at its internal
// component level, which includes 10 bipolar junction transistors. Several of
// the circuits are oscillators which run at frequencies up to hundreds of
// hertz and which switch state abruptly, increasing the computing demands of
// the emulation.

// Midway's 280-ZZZAP and Laguna Racer schematics don't label discrete
// components, though they do label ICs with their PCB coordinates, as well as
// IC pins. Midway's Super Speed Race schematic, however, does label discrete
// components, most of which directly correspond to the 280-ZZZAP and Laguna
// Racer ones. I have used the Super Speed Race labels for the 280-ZZZAP
// discrete components. IC components I have labeled with their 280-ZZZAP PCB
// coordinates, consistent with the 280-ZZZAP schematic. Each LM3900 IC
// contains 4 op-amps, so I have labeled these op-amps as _1 to _4, the same
// scheme used in the LM3900 datasheet, using the pin numbers on the schematic
// to identify the specific op-amp. Likewise, each CD4016 IC contains 4
// switches, so I identify a specific switch from its pin numbers on the
// schematic; these are labeled _A through _D in the CD4016 datasheet, so I
// use that scheme.

// The sound circuitry can be divided into three sections: engine sound
// generation and control, generation of noise-based sound effects (skidding
// and crashes), and the final mix and amplification of all sounds.


// When comparing the sound circuitry and components between 280-ZZZAP and
// Laguna Racer, here are some things to note. There are two different
// versions of the Laguna Racer game logic board (where the sound circuits
// reside): A622 and B622. Midway's A622 schematic was clearly copied directly
// from 280-ZZZAP's--even the letter indicators for change notes in
// 280-ZZZAP's circuitry remain, though the actual notes were blanked out.
// B622's schematics show sound circuitry differences from 280-ZZZAP and A622,
// and these differences are consistent with Midway's PCB drawings for *both*
// the A622 and B622 games boards. Some of them are also consistent with
// Wellburn's 280-ZZZAP PCB photo. So it seems that actual 280-ZZZAP boards
// lie somewhere between the 280-ZZZAP schematic and the B622 Laguna Racer
// schematic.


// Include special frontiers within engine sound oscillators whose purpose is
// to improve solution convergence by reducing the oscillators' inherent
// numeric instability. Also adjusts values of resistors associated with these
// oscillators to maintain their frequency and voltage levels.

#define CONVERGENCE_FRONTIERS   1

// Use the fast high-level emulation of the analog noise generator, based on
// passing the noise signal to a simple AFUNC that outputs a high or low level
// according to the sign of the noise. This sounds the same as an accurate run
// of the component-level noise generator, but it is fast enough to run in
// real time.

#define FAST_HLE_NOISE_GEN  1

// Enable a voltage limiter on the output of the op-amp which generates the
// post-crash sound. This removes voltage glitches from the output which would
// otherwise be audible when the netlist is run with a fixed 48 kHz timestep,
// as it is in MAME.

#define REMOVE_POST_CRASH_NOISE_GLITCHES  1

// are mostly alike but differ in a few key components. I use Aaron Giles'
// scheme for combining the two definitions in one file.

	// **** Conversion of accelerator level to "engine speed" control
	// **** voltage for engine sound, with capacitor-based "engine
	// **** inertia" and gear shift changes.

	// The accelerator pedal input gives a 4-bit digital value which the
	// microprocessor stores in 74174 latch F5. The 4-bit value from the
	// latch output is converted by a resistor network to an analog
	// current of about 5.5 to 43 microamps, depending on the accelerator
	// level, with 5.5 µA being "zero" and each additional accelerator
	// increment adding another 2.5 µA. This current is then converted to
	// a corresponding analog voltage by the first LM3900 op-amp H5_3 at a
	// ratio of about 0.25 volts per accelerator increment. This op-amp's
	// output charges or discharges capacitor C18, whose voltage provides
	// the reference input for the second op-amp H5_4. The charging and
	// discharging of C18 is how the engine sound's pitch and volume are
	// changed, so more accelerator will charge it faster, and less
	// accelerator will charge it slower or make it discharge faster.
	// Also, it can discharge faster than it can charge (RC time constants
	// of about 0.5 seconds vs. 2.2 seconds), so the engine will lose
	// speed faster than it will gain it. Normally ENGINE_SOUND_OFF is
	// low, but if it goes high (if you crash, or when the game is in
	// attract mode), it closes CD4016 switch G5_A, which almost instantly
	// discharges C18 through 270-ohm resistor R56 and cuts off the engine
	// sound completely.
	//
	// Op-amp H5_4's output, which is driven to match the input current
	// from capacitor C18, provides the actual speed voltage signal to the
	// engine sound oscillators. This voltage is shifted down in level
	// from H5_3, ranging from 0.7 to 4.1 V. It also accounts for gear
	// shift, via capacitor C19 and the two adjacent CD4016 switches G5_B
	// and G5_C. When in low gear, LO_SHIFT is active, switch G5_C is
	// closed, and C19 is discharged via 10K resistor R60. HI_SHIFT is
	// inactive, switch G5_B is open, and all the feedback current to H5_4
	// runs through its 560K feedback resistor R58. However, when in high
	// gear, the state of the two switches is reversed, and C19 is free to
	// slowly charge through 560K resistor R59 while supplying additional
	// feedback current to the op-amp without a resistor. This has the
	// effect of temporarily depressing (or slowing the growth of) H5_4's
	// output voltage while C19 is being charged until it eventually
	// reaches equilibrium, at which point the output voltage will be the
	// same as in the low-gear case. The effect is to slow down the engine
	// speed, as you would expect in a higher gear. Likewise, if the
	// accelerator is reduced in high gear, lowering the op-amp's input
	// current, the fall in the op-amp's output voltage is temporarily
	// delayed while C19 is charged until it has sufficiently discharged
	// through R59. Thus the rate of engine slowing is also lowered.

	// Some component values here were changed in the later version of the
	// Laguna Racer game logic board or in Super Speed Race.

	// **** Engine sound generation, using three triangle-wave oscillators
	// **** running at frequency and amplitude determined by engine speed
	// **** control voltage and modulated by MC3340 amplifier/attenuator.

	// Engine sound oscillators. There are three of these, at different
	// frequencies; all three are triangle-wave oscillators whose
	// frequency and amplitude are controlled by the "engine speed"
	// voltage signal output from LM3900 op-amp H5_4. Each oscillator is a
	// cascaded pair of LM3900s with a CD4016 switch. The switch feeds
	// into the reference input of the first op-amp, whose output is also
	// the final oscillator output; the second op-amp acts as a Schmitt
	// trigger on the first op-amp's output, generating a square wave that
	// controls the switch and determines whether the triangle wave is
	// rising or falling.

	// The two lower-frequency oscillators are summed together. One has
	// four times the frequency of the other, producing a "ragged"
	// triangle wave. The combined signal is fed into the signal input of
	// the MC3340 voltage-controlled amplifier/attenuator. The third,
	// highest-frequency oscillator drives the MC3340's control input,
	// amplitude-modulating the signal input from the first two
	// oscillators. Greater voltages on this control signal produce
	// greater attenuation in a logarithmic fashion. The final output
	// signal from the MC3340 thus has a waveform of narrow needle-like
	// spikes which grow taller and shorter according to the original
	// input waveform.

	// The Schmitt triggers in these oscillator circuits are numerically
	// unstable at the switching points, which makes numeric convergence
	// difficult. The standard way to guarantee convergence with such a
	// circuit is to use dynamic timestepping with very short minimum
	// timesteps. In this case that solution is unacceptably slow, so an
	// alternate solution is used instead. To remove the unstable behavior
	// of the Schmitt triggers in the solver, a "frontier" is inserted at
	// the output of each Schmitt trigger op-amp. With this, a change in
	// the op-amp's output level, caused by a change in its inputs, will
	// not affect either its feedback input or the CD4016 switch during
	// the same timestep. Instead, it will only take effect when computing
	// the following timestep. This greatly improves the stability and
	// performance of the solver while only slightly altering the
	// frequency and voltage levels of the oscillator's triangle-wave
	// output. These waveform changes are compensated for by slightly
	// adjusting the value of the resistors which determine the Schmitt
	// trigger's switch points, bringing the waveform very close to what
	// it would be if the standard approach of dynamic timestepping were
	// used instead.

	// **** Noise generation and noise-based sound effects: tire skid
	// **** (NOISE_CR_1), boom from crash (BOOM), post-crash noise
	// **** (NOISE_CR_2).

	// The noise generator circuit for 280-ZZZAP and Laguna Racer is based
	// on a reverse-biased 9.1-volt 1N5239 zener diode which generates a
	// noisy current for an LM3900 Norton op-amp input. This op-amp then
	// amplifies the noise so strongly that its output saturates, randomly
	// oscillating between the maximum and mininum values, producing a
	// quasi-digital random waveform which is then smoothed and filtered
	// by another op-amp to form a continuous analog noise signal.
	// Following circuits re-filter and reshape this noise for the
	// noise-based sound effects.
	//
	// The noise of zener diodes is not well controlled during their
	// manufacture, and it can vary widely in strength from one part to
	// another even within a single production lot. However, this
	// op-amp-based noise generator takes zener noise of unpredictable
	// strength and converts it into an analog noise stream whose strength
	// is predictable, determined by the response of the op-amp circuits.
	//
	// Super Speed Race generates its noise in a different fashion, using
	// a linear-feedback shift register on the main motherboard to
	// generate a true digital random noise signal. However, once this
	// digital noise has been generated, it gets smoothed and filtered
	// into continuous analog form in the same way and is further
	// processed through similar sound effect circuits.
	//
	// Since the noise generator discrete components are unlabeled on the
	// 280-ZZZAP and Laguna Racer schematics and are not present in Super
	// Speed Race, I've chosen my own labels for them.
	//
	// The netlist library supports zener diodes, but not zener noise. The
	// noise is simulated using an additional source of noise voltage.
	// This noise is handled in one of two ways, depending on how the
	// netlist is configured.
	//
	// If the netlist is configured for detailed circuit simulation, the
	// noise source is inserted in series between the zener diode's output
	// and the op-amp's non-inverting input. This netlist configuration
	// tries to accurately reproduce the amplified noise signal which the
	// op-amp would generate. Because of the rapidly changing noise signal
	// and the op-amp's high gain, however, producing an accurate,
	// glitch-free signal requires using dynamic time-stepping with a very
	// short minimum time step on the order of 10 nanoseconds. This has an
	// unacceptable impact on performance and is unsuitable for real-time
	// operation, like in a normal MAME session.
	//
	// For such operation, a simpler high-level emulation configuration is
	// used. Because of the very high gain of the op-amp, the real output
	// signal will always lie at either the op-amp's maximum or minimum
	// output value, almost never being in between. So we take the same
	// input noise signal and replace the op-amp with a simple AFUNC()
	// module which only checks the input signal's sign and outputs the
	// corresponding maximum or minimum value. This version runs much
	// faster, not requiring dynamic time-stepping at all for a
	// glitch-free result, and its output is very similar to running the
	// detailed emulation with a short minimum timestep. Once the output
	// has been smoothed and filtered, the two configurations will be
	// effectively identical, and there will be no difference in the
	// resulting sound effects except for how fast they are computed.

	// **** Final mix of sound effects and sound preamplification.

	// The preamplification stage after the final mix has two LM3900
	// op-amps. The audio power amplifier beyond it is a National
	// Semiconductor LM377 integrated dual power amp, with two 2-watt
	// power amps on the same chip. Both of these power amps drive the
	// single speaker from opposite ends in a push-pull fashion, a
	// so-called "bridge configuration" which effectively converts the
	// dual 2-watt power amp into a single 4-watt amp.

	// The two power amps get their inputs from the outputs of the two
	// LM3900 op-amps. The first LM3900, J5_3, pre-amplifies the signal
	// from the final mix and has a master volume potentiometer to control
	// its gain. Its output gets sent directly to one power amp and is
	// also passed to the second LM3900, J5_4, which inverts the signal
	// without changing the gain. The inverted signal is sent to the
	// second power amp that drives the speaker's other end. The first
	// LM3900 is AC-coupled to the second, and both are AC-coupled to the
	// power amps. As a result, the output signal of the second LM3900
	// more closely resembles the final output in waveform and tone
	// quality than the first LM3900's output does, so I have chosen the
	// second LM3900 as the final output for the emulation. The power amps
	// themselves are not emulated.

	// The master volume potentiometer is user-adjustable and is set to
	// its midpoint by default. Higher settings may produce clipped,
	// distorted output, but since the power amps are configured for a
	// voltage gain of 20 and use a 20 V power supply, this is likely true
