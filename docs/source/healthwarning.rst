Epilepsy Warning
----------------

A very small percentage of individuals may experience epileptic seizures when
exposed to certain light patterns or flashing lights. Exposure to certain
patterns or backgrounds on a television screen or computer monitor, or while
playing video games may induce an epileptic seizure in these individuals.

Certain conditions may induce previously undetected epileptic symptoms even in
persons who have no history of prior seizures or epilepsy. These conditions can
include emulation accuracy or inaccuracy, computer performance at the time of
running MAME, video card drivers, your monitor, and a lot of other factors.
If you, or anyone in your family, has an epileptic condition, consult your
physician prior to using MAME.

If you experience any of the following while using MAME, **IMMEDIATELY**
discontinue use and consult your physician before resuming use of MAME.

* Dizziness
