.. _luareference-intro:

Introduction
------------

Various aspects of MAME can be controlled using Lua scripting.  Many key classes
are exposed as Lua objects.

.. _luareference-intro-containers:

Containers
~~~~~~~~~~

Many properties yield container wrappers.  Container wrappers are cheap to
create, and provide an interface that is similar to a read-only table.  The
complexity of operations may vary.  Container wrappers usually provide most of
these operations:

#c
    Get the number of items in the container.
c[k]
    Returns the item corresponding to the key ``k``, or ``nil`` if the key is
    not present.
pairs(c)
    Iterate container by key and value.  The key is what you would pass to the
    index operator or the ``get`` method to get the value.
ipairs(c)
    Iterate container by index and value.  The index is what you would pass to
    the ``at`` method to get the value (this may be the same as the key for some
    containers).
c:empty()
    Returns a Boolean indicating whether there are no items in the container.
c:get(k)
    Returns the item corresponding to the key ``k``, or ``nil`` if the key is
    not present.  Usually equivalent to the index operator.
c:at(i)
    Returns the value at the 1-based index ``i``, or ``nil`` if it is out of
    range.
c:find(v)
    Returns the key for item ``v``, or ``nil`` if it is not in the container.
    The key is what you would pass to the index operator to get the value.
c:index_of(v)
    Returns the 1-based index for item ``v``, or ``nil`` if it is not in the
    container.  The index is what you would pass to the ``at`` method to get the
    value.


.. _luareference-core:

Core classes
------------

Many of MAME’s core classes used to implement an emulation session are available
to Lua scripts.

.. _luareference-core-mameman:

MAME machine manager
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Wraps MAME’s ``mame_machine_manager`` class, which holds the running machine, UI
manager, and other global components.

Instantiation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

manager
    The MAME machine manager is available as a global variable in the Lua
    environment.

Properties
^^^^^^^^^^

manager.machine (read-only)
    The :ref:`running machine <luareference-core-machine>` for the current
    emulation session.
manager.ui (read-only)
    The :ref:`UI manager <luareference-core-uiman>` for the current session.
manager.options (read-only)
    The :ref:`emulation options <luareference-core-emuopts>` for the current
    session.
manager.plugins[] (read-only)
    Gets information about the :ref:`Lua plugins <luareference-core-plugin>`
    that are present, indexed by name.  The index get, ``at`` and ``index_of``
    methods have O(n) complexity.

.. _luareference-core-machine:

Running machine
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Wraps MAME’s ``running_machine`` class, which represents an emulation session.
It provides access to the other core objects that implement an emulation session
as well as the emulated device tree.

Instantiation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

manager.machine
    Gets the running machine instance for the current emulation session.

Methods
^^^^^^^

machine:exit()
    Schedules an exit from the current emulation session.  This will either
    return to the system selection menu or exit the application, depending on
    how it was started.  This method returns immediately, before the scheduled
    exit takes place.
machine:hard_reset()
    Schedules a hard reset.  This is implemented by tearing down the emulation
    session and starting another emulation session for the same system.  This
    method returns immediately, before the scheduled reset takes place.
machine:soft_reset()
    Schedules a soft reset.  This is implemented by calling the reset method of
    the root device, which is propagated down the device tree.  This method
    returns immediately, before the scheduled reset takes place.
machine:save(filename)
    Schedules saving machine state to the specified file.  If the file name is a
    relative path, it is considered to be relative to the first configured save
    state directory.  This method returns immediately, before the machine state
    is saved.  If this method is called when a save or load operation is already
    pending, the previously pending operation will be cancelled.
machine:load(filename)
    Schedules loading machine state from the specified file.  If the file name
    is a relative path, the configured save state directories will be searched.
    This method returns immediately, before the machine state is saved.  If this
    method is called when a save or load operation is already pending, the
    previously pending operation will be cancelled.
machine:popmessage([msg])
    Displays a pop-up message to the user.  If the message is not provided, the
    currently displayed pop-up message (if any) will be hidden.
machine:logerror(msg)
    Writes the message to the machine error log.  This may be displayed in a
    debugger window, written to a file, or written to the standard error output.

Methods
^^^^^^^

video:frame_update()
    Updates emulated screens, reads host inputs, and updates video output.
video:snapshot()
    Saves snapshot files according to the current configuration.  If MAME is
    configured to take native emulated screen snapshots, one snapshot will be
    saved for each emulated screen that is visible in a host window/screen with
    the current view configuration.  If MAME is not configured to use take
    native emulated screen snapshots or if the system has no emulated screens, a
    single snapshot will be saved using the currently selected snapshot view.
video:begin_recording([filename], [format])
    Stops any video recordings currently in progress and starts recording either
    the visible emulated screens or the current snapshot view, depending on
    whether MAME is configured to take native emulated screen snapshots.

    If the file name is not supplied, the configured snapshot file name is used.
    If the file name is a relative path, it is interpreted relative to the first
    configured snapshot directory.  If the format is supplied, it must be
    ``"avi"`` or ``"mng"``.  If the format is not supplied, it defaults to AVI.
video:end_recording()
    Stops any video recordings that are in progress.
video:snapshot_size()
    Returns the width and height in pixels of snapshots created with the current
    snapshot target configuration and emulated screen state.  This may be
    configured explicitly by the user, or calculated based on the selected
    snapshot view and the resolution of any visible emulated screens.
video:snapshot_pixels()
    Returns the pixels of a snapshot created using the current snapshot target
    configuration as 32-bit integers packed into a binary string in host Endian
    order.  Pixels are organised in row-major order, from left to right then top
    to bottom.  Pixel values are colours in RGB format packed into 32-bit
    integers.

    command line or INI file), or has no effect if no WAV file name is
    configured.  Returns ``true`` if recording started, or ``false`` if
    recording is already in progress, opening the output file failed, or no file
    name was supplied or configured.
sound:stop_recording()
    Stops recording and closes the file if currently recording to a WAV file.

.. _luareference-dev:

Devices
-------

Several device classes and device mix-ins classes are exposed to Lua.  Devices
can be looked up by tag or enumerated.

.. _luareference-dev-enum:

Device enumerators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Device enumerators are special containers that allow iterating over devices and
looking up devices by tag.  A device enumerator can be created to find any kind
of device, to find devices of a particular type, or to find devices that
implement a particular interface.  When iterating using ``pairs`` or ``ipairs``,
devices are returned by walking the device tree depth-first in creation order.

The index get operator looks up a device by tag.  It returns ``nil`` if no
device with the specified tag is found, or if the device with the specified tag
does not meet the type/interface requirements of the device enumerator.  The
complexity is O(1) if the result is cached, but an uncached device lookup is
expensive.  The ``at`` method has O(n) complexity.

If you create a device enumerator with a starting point other than the root
machine device, passing an absolute tag or a tag containing parent references to
the index operator may return a device that would not be discovered by
iteration.  If you create a device enumerator with restricted depth, devices
that would not be found due to being too deep in the hierarchy can still be
looked up by tag.

Creating a device enumerator with depth restricted to zero can be used to
downcast a device or test whether a device implements a certain interface.  For
example this will test whether a device implements the media image interface:

.. code-block:: Lua

    image_intf = emu.image_enumerator(device, 0):at(1)
    if image_intf then
        print(string.format("Device %s mounts images", device.tag))

    Returns a device enumerator that will iterate over
    :ref:`slot devices <luareference-dev-dislot>` in the sub-tree starting at
    the specified device.  The specified device will be included if it is a
    slot device.  If the depth is provided, it must be an integer specifying the

^^^^^^^^^^^^

* :ref:`luareference-dev-device`

Methods
^^^^^^^

screen:orientation()
    Returns the rotation angle in degrees (will be one of 0, 90, 180 or 270),
    whether the screen is flipped left-to-right, and whether the screen is
    flipped top-to-bottom.  This is the final screen orientation after the
    screen orientation specified in the machine configuration and the rotation
    for the system driver are applied.
screen:time_until_pos(v, [h])
    Gets the time remaining until the raster reaches the specified position.  If
    the horizontal component of the position is not specified, it defaults to

    filename is not an absolute path, it is interpreted relative to the first
    configured snapshot path.  The filename may contain conversion specifiers
    that will be replaced by the system name or an incrementing number.

    Returns a file error if opening the snapshot file failed, or ``nil``
    otherwise.

    the origin at the top left corner of the visible area, increasing to the
    right and down.  Returns either a palette index or a colour in RGB format
    packed into a 32-bit integer.  Returns zero (0) if the specified point is
    outside the visible area.
screen:pixels()
    Returns all visible pixels as 32-bit integers packed into a binary string in
    host Endian order.  Pixels are organised in row-major order, from left to
    right then top to bottom.  Pixels values are either palette indices or
    colours in RGB format packed into 32-bit integers.
screen:draw_box(left, top, right, bottom, [line], [fill])
    Draws an outlined rectangle with edges at the specified positions.

    Coordinates are floating-point numbers in units of screen pixels, with the
    origin at (0, 0).  Note that screen pixels often aren’t square.  The
    coordinate system is rotated if the screen is rotated, which is usually the
    case for vertical-format screens.  Before rotation, the origin is at the top
    left, and coordinates increase to the right and downwards.  Coordinates are
    limited to the screen area.

    The fill and line colours are in alpha/red/green/blue (ARGB) format.
    Channel values are in the range 0 (transparent or off) to 255 (opaque or
    full intensity), inclusive.  Colour channel values are not pre-multiplied by
    the alpha value.  The channel values must be packed into the bytes of a
    32-bit unsigned integer, in the order alpha, red, green, blue from
    most-significant to least-significant byte.  If the line colour is not
    provided, the UI text colour is used; if the fill colour is not provided,
    the UI background colour is used.
screen:draw_line(x1, y1, x2, y2, bottom, [color])

    Coordinates are floating-point numbers in units of screen pixels, with the
    origin at (0, 0).  Note that screen pixels often aren’t square.  The
    coordinate system is rotated if the screen is rotated, which is usually the
    case for vertical-format screens.  Before rotation, the origin is at the top
    left, and coordinates increase to the right and downwards.  Coordinates are
    limited to the screen area.

    The line colour is in alpha/red/green/blue (ARGB) format.  Channel values
    are in the range 0 (transparent or off) to 255 (opaque or full intensity),
    inclusive.  Colour channel values are not pre-multiplied by the alpha value.
    The channel values must be packed into the bytes of a 32-bit unsigned
    integer, in the order alpha, red, green, blue from most-significant to
    least-significant byte.  If the line colour is not provided, the UI text
    colour is used.
screen:draw_text(x|justify, y, text, [foreground], [background])
    Draws text at the specified position.  If the screen is rotated the text
    will be rotated.

    If the first argument is a number, the text will be left-aligned at this X
    coordinate.  If the first argument is a string, it must be ``"left"``,
    ``"center"`` or ``"right"`` to draw the text left-aligned at the
    left edge of the screen, horizontally centred on the screen, or
    right-aligned at the right edge of the screen, respectively.  The second
    argument specifies the Y coordinate of the maximum ascent of the text.

    Coordinates are floating-point numbers in units of screen pixels, with the
    origin at (0, 0).  Note that screen pixels often aren’t square.  The
    coordinate system is rotated if the screen is rotated, which is usually the
    case for vertical-format screens.  Before rotation, the origin is at the top
    left, and coordinates increase to the right and downwards.  Coordinates are
    limited to the screen area.

    The foreground and background colours is in alpha/red/green/blue (ARGB)
    format.  Channel values are in the range 0 (transparent or off) to 255 (opaque or full intensity),
    inclusive.  Colour channel values are not pre-multiplied by the alpha value.
    The channel values must be packed into the bytes of a 32-bit unsigned
    integer, in the order alpha, red, green, blue from most-significant to
    least-significant byte.  If the foreground colour is not provided, the UI

    the index in the ``devices`` property of the device class – the ``devindex``
    indices may not be contiguous.
inputdev.items (read-only)
    Gets a table of :ref:`input items <luareference-input-inputitem>`, indexed
    by item ID.  The item ID is an enumerated value.

.. _luareference-input-inputitem:

    Gets an individual host input item.  The item ID is an enumerated value.

Properties
^^^^^^^^^^

item.name (read-only)
    The display name of the input item.  Note that this is just the name of the
    item itself, and does not include the device name.  The full display name
    for the item can be obtained by calling the ``code_name`` method on the
    :ref:`input manager <luareference-input-inputman>` with the item’s code.

    the :ref:`render target <luareference-render-target>` it falls in.  The
    position is in host pixels, where zero is at the top/left.  The button state
    is a Boolean indicating whether the primary mouse button is pressed.

    If the mouse pointer is not over one of MAME’s windows, this may return the
    position and render target from when the mouse pointer was most recently
    over one of MAME’s windows.  The render target may be ``nil`` if the mouse
    pointer is not over one of MAME’s windows.

.. _luareference-render-bounds:

Render bounds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Wraps MAME’s ``render_bounds`` class, which represents a rectangle using
floating-point coordinates.

Instantiation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

emu.render_bounds()
    Creates a render bounds object representing a unit square, with top left
    corner at (0, 0) and bottom right corner at (1, 1).  Note that render
    target coordinates don’t necessarily have equal X and Y scales, so this may
    not represent a square in the final output.
emu.render_bounds(left, top, right, bottom)
    Creates a render bounds object representing a rectangle with top left
    corner at (x0, y0) and bottom right corner at (x1, y1).

    The arguments must all be floating-point numbers.

Methods
^^^^^^^

bounds:includes(x, y)
    Returns a Boolean indicating whether the specified point falls within the
    rectangle.  The rectangle must be normalised for this to work (right greater
    than left and bottom greater than top).

    The arguments must both be floating-point numbers.
bounds:set_xy(left, top, right, bottom)
    Set the rectangle’s position and size in terms of the positions of the
    edges.

    The arguments must all be floating-point numbers.
bounds:set_wh(left, top, width, height)
    Set the rectangle’s position and size in terms of the top top left corner
    position, and the width and height.

    edge or the top left corner).
bounds.y1 (read/write)
    The bottommost coordinate in the rectangle (i.e. the Y coordinate of the
    bottom edge or the bottom right corner).
bounds.width (read/write)
    The width of the rectangle.  Setting this property changes the position of
    the rightmost edge.
bounds.height (read/write)
    The height of the rectangle.  Setting this property changes the position of
    the bottommost edge.
bounds.aspect (read-only)
    The width-to-height aspect ratio of the rectangle.  Note that this is often
    in render target coordinates which don’t necessarily have equal X and Y
    scales.  A rectangle representing a square in the final output doesn’t
    necessarily have an aspect ratio of 1.

.. _luareference-render-color:

Render colour
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Wraps MAME’s ``render_color`` class, which represents an ARGB (alpha, red,
green, blue) format colour.  Channels are floating-point values ranging from

intensity).  Colour channel values are not pre-multiplied by the alpha channel
value.

Instantiation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

emu.render_color()
    Creates a render colour object representing opaque white (all channels set
    to 1).  This is the identity value – ARGB multiplication by this value will
    not change a colour.

    The :ref:`views <luareference-render-layview>` created from the layout file.
    Views are indexed by unqualified name (i.e. the value of the ``name``
    attribute).  Views are ordered how they appear in the layout file when
    iterating or using the ``at`` method.  The index get, ``at`` and
    ``index_of`` methods have O(n) complexity.

    Note that not all views in the XML file may be created.  For example views

    said slot card devices are not present in the system.

.. _luareference-render-layview:

Layout view
~~~~~~~~~~~

Wraps MAME’s ``layout_view`` class, representing a view that can be displayed in

    to the render target in preparation for drawing a video frame.  The function
    must accept no arguments.  Call with ``nil`` to remove the callback.
view:set_preload_callback(cb)
    Set a function to perform additional tasks after preloading visible view
    items.  The function must accept no arguments.  Call with ``nil`` to remove
    the callback.

    This function may be called when the user selects a view or makes an item
    collection visible.  It may be called multiple times for a view, so avoid
    repeating expensive tasks.
view:set_recomputed_callback(cb)
    Set a function to perform additional tasks after the view’s dimensions are
    recomputed.  The function must accept no arguments.  Call with ``nil`` to
    remove the callback.

    function must accept no arguments and return an integer.  Call with ``nil``
    to restore the default element state callback (based on bindings in the XML
    layout file).

    Note that the function must not access the item’s ``element_state``
    property, as this will result in infinite recursion.

    This callback will not be used to obtain the animation state for the item,
    even if the item lacks explicit animation state bindings in the XML layout
    file.
item.set_animation_state_callback(cb)
    Set a function to call to obtain the animation state for the item.  The
    function must accept no arguments and return an integer.  Call with ``nil``

    Note that the function must not access the item’s ``animation_state``
    property, as this will result in infinite recursion.
item.set_bounds_callback(cb)
    Set a function to call to obtain the bounds for the item.  The function must
    accept no arguments and return a
    :ref:`render bounds <luareference-render-bounds>` object in render target
    coordinates.  Call with ``nil`` to restore the default bounds callback
    (based on the item’s animation state and ``bounds`` child elements in the
    XML layout file).

    Note that the function must not access the item’s ``bounds`` property, as
    this will result in infinite recursion.
item.set_color_callback(cb)
    Set a function to call to obtain the multiplier colour for the item.  The
    function must accept no arguments and return a
    :ref:`render colour <luareference-render-color>` object.  Call with ``nil``

    and ``color`` child elements in the XML layout file).

    Note that the function must not access the item’s ``color`` property, as
    this will result in infinite recursion.

Properties
^^^^^^^^^^

    element texture is multiplied by this colour.  This is a
    :ref:`render colour <luareference-render-color>` object.
item.blend_mode (read-only)
    Get the item’s blend mode.  This is an integer value, where 0 means no
    blending, 1 means alpha blending, 2 means RGB multiplication, 3 means
    additive blending, and -1 allows the items within a container to specify
    their own blending modes.
item.orientation (read-only)
    Get the item orientation flags.  This is an integer bit mask, where bit 0
    (0x01) is set to mirror horizontally, bit 1 (0x02) is set to mirror

    defaults to just breaking into the debugger.  Returns the watchpoint number
    for the new watchpoint.

    If specified, the condition must be a debugger expression that will be
    evaluated each time the breakpoint is hit.  Execution will only be stopped
    if the expression evaluates to a non-zero value.  The variable 'wpaddr' is
    set to the address that actually triggered the watchpoint, the variable
    'wpdata' is set to the data that is being read or written, and the variable
    'wpsize' is set to the size of the data in bytes.  If the condition is not
    specified, it defaults to always active.
debug:wpenable([wp])
    Enable the specified watchpoint, or all watchpoints for the device if no
    watchpoint number is specified.  Returns whether the specified number
    matched a watchpoint if a watchpoint number is specified, or ``nil`` if no
    watchpoint number is specified.
debug:wpdisable([wp])
    Disable the specified watchpoint, or all watchpoints for the device if no
    watchpoint number is specified.  Returns whether the specified number
    matched a watchpoint if a watchpoint number is specified, or ``nil`` if no
    watchpoint number is specified.
debug:wpclear([wp])
    Clear the specified watchpoint, or all watchpoints for the device if no
    watchpoint number is specified.  Returns whether the specified number
    matched a watchpoint if a watchpoint number is specified, or ``nil`` if no
    watchpoint number is specified.
debug:wplist(space)
    Returns a table of watchpoints for the specified address space of the
    device.  The keys are the watchpoint numbers, and the values are
    :ref:`watchpoint objects <luareference-debug-watchpoint>`.

.. _luareference-debug-breakpoint:

Breakpoint
~~~~~~~~~~

Wraps MAME’s ``debug_breakpoint`` class, representing a breakpoint for an
emulated CPU device.

Instantiation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

manager.machine.devices[tag]:debug():bplist()[bp]
    Gets the specified breakpoint for an emulated CPU device, or ``nil`` if no
    breakpoint corresponds to the specified index.

Properties
^^^^^^^^^^

breakpoint.index (read-only)
    The breakpoint’s index.  The can be used to enable, disable or clear the
    breakpoint via the
    :ref:`CPU debugger interface <luareference-debug-devdebug>`.
breakpoint.enabled (read-only)
    A Boolean indicating whether the breakpoint is currently enabled.
breakpoint.address (read-only)
    The breakpoint’s address.
breakpoint.condition (read-only)
    A debugger expression evaluated each time the breakpoint is hit.  The action
    will only be triggered if this expression evaluates to a non-zero value.  An
    empty string if no condition was specified.
breakpoint.action (read-only)
    An action the debugger will run when the breakpoint is hit and the condition
    evaluates to a non-zero value.  An empty string if no action was specified.

.. _luareference-debug-watchpoint:

Watchpoint
~~~~~~~~~~

Wraps MAME’s ``debug_watchpoint`` class, representing a watchpoint for an
emulated CPU device.

Instantiation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

manager.machine.devices[tag]:debug():wplist(space)[wp]
    Gets the specified watchpoint for an address space of an emulated CPU
    device, or ``nil`` if no watchpoint in the address space corresponds to the
    specified index.

Properties
^^^^^^^^^^

watchpoint.index (read-only)
    The watchpoint’s index.  The can be used to enable, disable or clear the
    watchpoint via the
    :ref:`CPU debugger interface <luareference-debug-devdebug>`.
watchpoint.enabled (read-only)
    A Boolean indicating whether the watchpoint is currently enabled.
watchpoint.type (read-only)
    Either ``"r"``, ``"w"`` or ``"rw"`` for a read, write or read/write
    watchpoint.
watchpoint.address (read-only)
    The starting address of the watchpoint’s address range.
watchpoint.length (read-only)
    The length of the watchpoint’s address range.
watchpoint.condition (read-only)
    A debugger expression evaluated each time the watchpoint is hit.  The action
    will only be triggered if this expression evaluates to a non-zero value.  An
    empty string if no condition was specified.
watchpoint.action (read-only)
    An action the debugger will run when the watchpoint is hit and the condition
    evaluates to a non-zero value.  An empty string if no action was specified.
