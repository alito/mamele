MAME Naming Conventions

Introduction
------------

To promote consistency and readability in MAME source code, we have some
naming conventions for various elements.


.. _naming-definitions:

Definitions
-----------

Snake case
    All lowercase letters with words separated by underscores:
    ``this_is_snake_case``
Screaming snake case
    All uppercase letters with words separated by underscores:
    ``SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE``
Camel case:
    Lowercase initial letter, first letter of each subsequent word
    capitalised, with no separators between words: ``exampleCamelCase``
Llama case:
    Uppercase initial letter, first letter of each subsequent word
    capitalised, with no separators between words: ``LlamaCaseSample``


.. _naming-transliteration:

Transliteration
---------------

For better or worse, the most broadly recognised script in the world is
English Latin.  Conveniently, it’s also included in almost all character
encodings.  To make MAME more globally accessible, we require Latin
transliterations of titles and other metadata from other scripts.  Do
not use translations in metadata – translations are inherently
subjective and error-prone.  Translations may be included in comments if
they may be helpful.

If general, if an official Latin script name is known, it should be used
in favour of a naïve transliteration.  For titles containing foreign
loanwords, the conventional Latin spelling should be used for the
loanwords (the most obvious example of this is the use of “Mahjong” in
Japanese titles rather than “Maajan”).

Chinese
    Where the primary audience was Mandarin-speaking, Hanyu Pinyin
    should be used.  In contexts where diacritics are not permitted
    (e.g. when limited to ASCII), tone numbers should be omitted.  When
    tones are being indicated using diacritics, tone sandhi rules should
    be applied.  Where the primary audience was Cantonese-speaking
    (primarily Hong Kong and Guandong), Jyutping should be used with
    tone numbers omitted.  If in doubt, use Hanyu Pinyin.
Greek
    Use ISO 843:1997 type 2 (TR) rules.  Do not use traditional English
    spellings for Greek names (people or places).
Japanese
    Modified Hepburn rules should generally be used.  Use an apostrophe
    between syllabic N and a following vowel (including iotised vowels).
    Do not use hyphens to transliterate prolonged vowels.
Korean
    Use Revised Romanisation of Korean (RR) rules with traditional
    English spelling for Korean surnames.  Do not use ALA-LC rules for
    word division and use of hyphens.
Vietnamese
    When diacritics can’t be used, omit the tones and replace the vowels
    with single English vowels – do not use VIQR or TELEX conventions
    (“an chuot nuong” rather than “a(n chuo^.t nu*o*'ng” or “awn chuootj
    nuowngs”).


.. _naming-titles:

Titles and descriptions
-----------------------

Try to reproduce the original title faithfully where possible.  Try to
preserve the case convention used by the manufacturer/publisher.  If no
official English Latin title is known, use a standard transliteration.
For software list entries where a transliteration is used for the
``description`` element, put the title in an ``info`` element with a
``name="alt_title"`` attribute.

For software items that have multiple titles (for example different
regional titles with the same installation media), use the most most
widespread English Latin title for the ``description`` element, and put
the other titles in ``info`` elements with ``name="alt_title"``
attributes.

If disambiguation is needed, try to be descriptive as possible.  For
example, use the manufacturer’s version number, regional licensee’s
name, or terse description of hardware differences in preference to
arbitrary set numbers.  Surround the disambiguation text with
parentheses, preserve original case for names and version text, but
use lowercase for anything else besides proper nouns.


.. _naming-cplusplus:

C++ naming conventions
----------------------

Preprocessor macros
    Macro names should use screaming snake case.  Macros are always
    global and name conflicts can cause confusing errors – think
    carefully about what macros really need to be in headers and name
    them carefully.
Include guards
    Include guard macros should begin with ``MAME_``, and end with a
    capitalised version of the file name, withe separators replaced by
    underscores.
Constants
    Constants should use screaming snake case, whether they are constant
    globals, constant data members, enumerators or preprocessor
    constants.
Functions
    Free functions names should use snake case.  (There are some utility
    function that were previously implemented as preprocessor macros
    that still use screaming snake case.)
Classes
    Class names should use snake case.  Abstract class names should end
    in ``_base``.  Public member functions (including static member
    functions) should use snake case.
Device classes
    Concrete driver ``driver_device`` implementation names
    conventionally end in ``_state``, while other concrete device class
    names end in ``_device``.  Concrete ``device_interface`` names
    conventionally begin with ``device_`` and end with ``_interface``.
Device types
    Device types should use screaming snake case.  Remember that device
    types are names in the global namespace, so choose explicit,
    unambiguous names.
Enumerations
    The enumeration name should use snake case.  The enumerators should
    use screaming snake case.
Template parameters
    Template parameters should use llama case (both type and value
    parameters).
